PROTOCOL VERSION 1


as of 2009-08-24, this is the current protocol for the dispatcher. for now, this
protocol is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS until marked otherwise.

================================================================================

GENERAL PROTOCOL LAYOUT


the protocol is based on int32_t in network byte order. if not marked different,
any field is an int32_t and any size- or count-field gives the size or count of
int32_t's.

================================================================================

ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION TO THE SERVER


a client may establish a connection to the dispatcher via a socket to a
tcp-port. the default port is 24940 ( 'al', hex 0x61 0x6c ). the port may be
changed in the server via its command-line options.

after connection, the server sends its capabilities (as if requested via the
CAPA command) and goes into interactive mode.

================================================================================

INTERACTIVE MODE


in interactive mode, the server waits for a command from the client. it then
executes the command and sends the reply immediately. after that, it again goes
into interactive mode.

================================================================================

DATA TYPES


int32_t

all fields are, if not marked otherwise, of int32_t (in network-byte order),
i.e. a singed integer of 32 bits.


errno

error code, as in enum command_error_code in protocol.h. 0 if success.


bool

a bool is a int32_t interpreted in the following way: if 0, it is false.
otherwise it is true.


acceptance

an acceptance is an int32_t interpreted in the following way:
false = 0, unknown = 1, true = 2
it corresponds to a libalf::extended_bool (defined in include/libalf/answer.h)


object-id

an object-id is an int32_t. any valid object will have an object-id >= 0. a
negative object-id represents an invalid object or means "no object" or "error".


char

a char is an ascii-byte, i.e. it is 8 bits wide. it is used to represent
standard, human readable text.


character-string

a character-string is a length field (int32_t) giving the number of chars,
followed by the announced number of chars. the string is NOT \0-delimited!

================================================================================

PROTOCOL CONSTANTS

libalf/dispatcher/include/protocol.h

and

libalf/include/learning_algorithm.h (enum learning_algorithm::algorithm)

and

libalf/include/normalizer.h (enum normalizer::type)

================================================================================

CLIENT COMMANDS


a client command consists of the following:
	enum client_command,
then for each parameter:
	parameter

if a parameter is marked with ``[]'', it is of variable size. the size has to be
submitted by the command itself somehow. (see e.g. CLCMD_OBJECT_COMMAND).
otherwise the size of a parameter is exactly one int32_t.


the following commands exist:


request capabilities (CLCMD_REQ_CAPA)
no parameters.
server returns:
	errno
only if above was ERR_SUCCESS:
	character-string ( space-separated list of capabilities,
			   e.g. "protocol-version-1 tls auth langen" )

no parameters.
server returns:
	errno (always ERR_SUCCESS)
	character-string

	errno (0 if server liked you)
server then disconnects

parameters:
	enum object_type
	size of data (always, even if size is 0)
	data[] (depending on object_type, see CREATING AN OBJECT)
server returns:
	errno
only if above was ERR_SUCCESS:
	object-id


delete object (CLCMD_DELETE_OBJECT)
parameters:
	object-id
server returns:
	errno


get object_type (CLCMD_GET_OBJECTTYPE)

	command-id (depending on object_type one of
		enum logger_command,
		enum knowledgebase_command,
		enum knowledgebase_iterator_command,
		enum algorithm_command,
		enum normalizer_command )
	size of additional parameters (NOT count!),
	additional parameters[]
server returns:
	errno
only if above was ERR_SUCCESS:
	data[] -- see specific command --


count dispatcher-internal references of obj (CLCMD_COUNT_DISPATCHER_REFERENCES)
parameters: 1
	object-id
server returns:
	errno
only if above was ERR_SUCCESS:
	int reference_count


say hello to carsten (CLCMD_HELLO_CARSTEN)
parameters: 1
	int (how often)
server returns:
	errno
only if above was ERR_SUCCESS:
	int (how often he said thanks)

================================================================================

CREATING AN OBJECT

depengin on object_type, the following data is expected:

OBJ_LOGGER:

parameter size (not count): 0
parameters: none.

OBJ_KNOWLEDGEBASE:

parameter size (not count): 0
parameters: none.

OBJ_KNOWLEDGEBASE_ITERATOR:

parameter size (not count): 0
parameters: none.

OBJ_LEARNING_ALGORITHM:

parameter size (not count): 2
parameters:
	enum libalf::learning_algorithm::algorithm
			(see libalf/include/libalf/learning_algorithm.h)
	alphabet_size

OBJ_NORMALIZER:

parameter size (not count): 1
parameters:
	enum libalf::normalizer::type
			(see libalf/include/libalf/normalizer.h)

================================================================================

DELETING AN OBJECT


NOTE that if you delete an object that is referenced by another object, or that
is referring to another object, the reference is resolved and the object is
removed from the referring/referenced object.

e.g. if you have an algorithm-object that uses a logger-object, and delete the
logger-object, the algorithm-object will automatically be notified and remove
its reference to the logger-object.

if you have a knowledgebase-iterator and remove the knowledgebase it is
referring, the iterator will be invalidated (but still be an iterator object)
